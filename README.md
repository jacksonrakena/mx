An open-source, personal-use-first, **principled** financial analysis software.

### Principled?
Principled means the following:
1. Doesn't sell your data or move it anywhere else (obviously)
2. **Doesn't ask for your internet banking credentials.**
   1. Competing budget/net worth tracking software in the Australia/New Zealand markets - like [WeMoney](https://www.wemoney.com.au/) - ask for your log on credentials to your internet banking (Westpac, NAB, Commonwealth Bank, etc), and then log in as you to pull your account information to show in the app.
   2. Not only is this dangerous - but it [violates your bank's terms & conditions](https://www.consumer.org.nz/articles/poli-payments-how-it-affects-and-breaches-your-banking-security), leaving you open to possible consequences.
   3. Additionally, these services aren't upfront about this behaviour. Some of them impersonate your bank's login page, and don't say anywhere that they're recording your banking credentials.

### Screenshots
Still heavily in-development, but asset object tracking, as well as ledger entries (how assets change in valuation over time) is implemented.
